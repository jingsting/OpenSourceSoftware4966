Licences allow people to freely use, modify and share softwares. It is important to choose one because although most of them achieves similar goals, their definition of a free and open source software may vary slightly. For example some supports patent grant, and some don't

We should make sure to use a project that has explicit license because without it we are not protected to freely use modify and share softwares. We should also keep an eye on the license of the software because it can be changed.

I agree with the claim. When Gopher failed to bring developers on to the track that they are working towards, many different version of approach appeard because everybody are forking, and not deciding on one approach. Gopher didn't take part in the IETF's procedures and released a Request for Comments later which didn't work as good.

Linux is first released by Linus Torvalds, who was bothered by the licensing of MINIX. Linux switch from its original license that doesn't allow commercial redistribution to the GNU GPL. Linux became popular very much because it's free to use, modify and share.

For GPL, you may copy, distribute and modify the software, but you need to track changes. Any modification should also be using GPL. 
LGPL is similar to GPL, but is mostly for libraries.
Apache allows you to do whatever you want with the software, but you need to include required nnotices. It contains a patent license from the contributeors.

I'm thinking about writing a simple VOIP program to learn how it works. It would also be helpful for me since I need a voice chat program when I play games occasionally with my friends back home, and discord's server doesn't work well in China. So the users are going to be me and my friends back home. The license I chose is MIT license since it is simple and the program is used, at this stage, for a small group of people.
